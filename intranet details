An intranet (not to be confused with the internet) is a local or restricted network that enables employees to store, organize, and share information within an organization
Often managed by IT and leveraged by various departments across an organization, the company intranet can be a powerful tool for addressing today’s digital workplace challenges.
In a recent study, 80% of employees working in medium and large-sized organizations said their company has an intranet, and that it is a tool they rely on regularly. In fact, 81% had used it in the last week.
The bad news is that this tool that employees rely on regularly is still slowing them down
43% of employees avoided sharing a document with a colleague because they could not find it or believed it would take too long to find.
Only 29% of employees knew how to submit an idea.
Only 30% knew how to request resources from another team.
Less than 25% knew where to find their corporate brochure.
Only 50% knew how to submit an IT request or book a vacation
Before we dive into specific uses of an intranet, it is important to set aside any baggage that the word “intranet” has accumulated over the years
